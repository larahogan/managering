### Example: Assess mentorship skills

**Signal to gather:** How does the candidate approach pairing? How does the candidate approach teaching? What traits of good mentorship have they experienced? What steps does the candidate take when they don’t know the answer to a mentee’s question?
						
**Interviewer guidelines:** Use as much time as you want (or as little as you want) to gauge the candidate’s approach to pairing as a mentor. It’s totally cool to spend a lot of time asking them behavioral questions about their experiences (versus pairing time), if that feels best.
